A demo project for the stateless components and behaviors.

Written in Scala just because I'm learning the language.

This project can be built with either Maven or Simple Build Tool (SBT).
To run with sbt, install SBT, run sbt in this directory and type 'update' then jetty-run at the prompt.

Or to run the tests:
sbt update && sbt test
mvn test

See the demo project (sibling of this) for more examples of usage of the library.

Usage of stateless Ajax components and behaviors:

 - the components which have to be repainted should have stable/hardcoded
 markup ids
 This is needed because every request creates a new instance of the page and re-creates
 all components in it, thus the auto-assigned markup id by Wicket can be different
 than the one assigned at the previous page/component render.
 Example:
	Label label = new Label("l1", "Model");
	label.setMarkupId("somethingStable");
